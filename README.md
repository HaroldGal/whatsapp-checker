Personal project to analyze my WhatsApp history using modern data tools.
Simple, local-first setup that showcases clean data engineering practices.
Useful project to test technologies.

## ðŸ”§ Stack
- **Apache Iceberg** for versioned, queryable tables

- [ ] Provision GCS bucket via Terraform;
- [ ] Upload parsed data to GCS following Apache Iceberg practices;
- [ ] Create usable layers of data with CLI tools;
- [ ] Have visualisation or toolbox to get some KPIs (TO DEFINE).
